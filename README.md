# Flit
A lightweight & versatile text editor. Extended version of the text editor [kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108).

# Attributions
Built upon [antirez's kilo](http://antirez.com/news/108), following a step-by-step guide by [snaptoken](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/).

# Diff
The decision to complete a step-by-step guide rather than just fork the kilo repository was made so I could learn about the development process of a low-level text editor. "Flit" differs to kilo (as at the end of the guide) through added features such as:
-   Line numbers
-   Selection
-   Copy & Paste
